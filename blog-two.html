            I have watched a lot of movies, but few movies have stayed with me over the years as these have. Take a look at some of my favorite movies below.<br/><br/>
            
            1)Gadar : One of Sunny Deol's best movies, it is the story of a Sikh man who marries a Pakistani woman who crossed the border by mistake. They have a child but they are soon separated as the parents of the girl take her back home. How Tara, the protagonist reunites his family is the crux of this story.<br/><br/>

            2)Koi Mil Gaya: Rohit lost his dad in an accident when he was little, he was in the same car, in his mother's womb. Because of the accident, Rohit has a disability, even though he is older, his brain is the same as a little kid. How Rohit meets an alien, overcomes his problems and lets the alien go in a supreme act of self sacrifice is what makes this story great.<br/><br/>

            3)Lagaan : Aamir Khan plays Bhuvan, a farmer who lives in a village taxed heavily by the British. Based in pre-independence India, Bhuvan and his friends stake it all on a cricket match between themselves and the British, to waive off all their taxes, or'Lagaan'.<br/><br/>

            4)Dil Chahta Hai : A  tale of three friends, with unique love lives, and unique ways of navigating said love lives. A path breaking film which represented the youth like they were, away from typical bollywood dramatic representation.<br/><br/>

            5)Dangal : A father wanted sons so they could carry his legacy as a wrestler, forward. However, he was blessed with daughters. How this family overcame societal taboo to sire multiple champion athletes is the story of Dangal.<br/><br/>

            6)Good Will Hunting : Will Hunting is a gifted but poor orphan who works as a Janitor at a university. He sneaks around solving complicated math on the boards for fun until one of the professors finds him out. FOr the first time in his life, Will has a choice, a means to get out of squalor and make a life for himself.
