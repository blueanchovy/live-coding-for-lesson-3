            The world is full of great books and it is impossible to read them all in a single lifetime. However, you hear about some books all the time, and when you actually get to reading them, you find that they were worth your time. Here are some of my favorite books.<br/><br/>

            1)Thinking Fast and Slow : Written by the Nobel Prize winning social scientist Daniel Kahneman, this book talks about the different types of thinking we employ for doing different tasks. A great primer to cognitive science, heuristics and biases.<br/><br/>

            2)Harry Potter and the methods of Rationality : This Harry Potter fanfic imagines a parallel universe where Harry is raised by scientists and has a rational outlook on life, which comes very handy when battling the evilest wizard of all time.<br/><br/>

            3)A Little Life : The saddest book I've ever read, 'A Little Life' by Hanya Yanagihara tells the story of an orphan, who was abused as a child. How he tries to navigate life with these hidden scars is how this story unfolds.<br/><br/>

            4)Nirmala : A classic novel by Premchand, this is the story of Nirmala, a young woman in a poor family whose father dies. Because of this sudden twist of fate, she is married to a much older, although rich, man. How she navigates this life, where her husband's sons are the same age as her makes for a riveting read.<br/><br/>

            5)Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman : The memoirs of the Nobel prize winning physicist talk about his approach to life, work, etc. We get a rare look at one of the greatest minds of the 20th century and it makes for a delightful read.<br/><br/>
